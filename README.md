# Hi, I’m @akickia! 
Junior frontend developer with great interest in development and teaching. 


👋<br>
My name is Kicki Lindstrand and I'm a middleaged woman located in Sweden, married with Martin and the mother of three kids. We also have a 🐩 named Sixten. I've worked about 10 years with education, but decided to try something new. Started coding in the end of 2021.


📖<br>
I’m currently learning frontend development from Folkuniversitetet, Gothenburg. I will be finished summer of 2024.
Earlier I have completed an intense education from Sundsgårdens folkhögskola in frontend.  


:octocat:<br>
Here on Github you can find projects I've made in school or in my free time and you can follow my development. Hopefully there is a short description for each project, but I'm happy to tell you more if there is something missing or unclear.
