- 👋 Hi, I’m @akickia. My name is Kicki, soon to bee 40 years old, married with Martin and the mother of three kids. 
- 👀 I’m interested in a new career. I've been a preschoolteacher for over ten years and love that job, but the stress is a problem for my health. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to develop webbpages, and have been looking at different programming languages. We'll see where I'll end up... 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on good educations for learning programming and development, and perhaps other things for other newbies. I'm very much a beginner, but is eager to learn new things. 
- 📫 How to reach me: you can find me at kicki.lindstrand@gmail.com
